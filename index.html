        <div class="subheading mb-5">English MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Gabriella Haines and I'm an English major at the University of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m a transfer student from Riverside Community College and have been at the university for nearly two years. I have a 3.9 GPA and am set to graduate by Spring 2021. My work experience includes writing 500-word blog posts at an LED lighting, signage, and electric bike company called Greenlight Innovations. I researched background information on the basics of green lighting and electric bikes to assist me in my blog writing. I also wrote posts detailing tips for small businesses, and found pictures to go with my blog posts. I submitted five blog posts a month and edited each one as my supervisor got back to me with a review each week. I reported to my supervisor throughout the process of researching, writing, and posting my blogs, and we worked together closely throughout my time at Greenlight Innovations.I worked here from May 2018 to April 2019. <br><br>

        As an English major, writing well is integral to getting my point across, whether it be through an argumentative essay, research paper, or topic summary. Iâ€™ve gained many valuable skills throughout my years at the University of California, Riverside due to my choice in major. Iâ€™ve written countless essays, researched subjects extensively, and analyzed numerous books and articles. Critical thinking is an important aspect of analysis, and itâ€™s an essential skill Iâ€™ve honed with my reading and writing experience. Organizing my ideas logically, developing arguments, and communicating my thoughts clearly are other aspects of my major that will make me a valuable addition to a variety of teams. I hope to bring value to the workplace through my writing, editing, and research skills - all of which have been honed throughout my years at UCR. <br><br>

        My career goals primarily revolve around writing for a living - as long as I can make a career out of writing, Iâ€™ll be happy. I want to use my English degree for a variety of fields, including journalism, editing, and technical writing. I plan on getting a technical writing certificate from UCRâ€™s continuation school in order to pursue a path as a technical writer after graduation this year. However, I also want to apply to internships that showcase other aspects of writing, such as marketing, blog writing, publishing, editing, and research. I want to gain experience in various types of writing, so taking on internships or jobs with contrasting types of work will hopefully benefit me in the end. While choosing one path is difficult, Iâ€™m confident that I can excel in various jobs with the help of my English degree. After a few years working with my English degree, Iâ€™m hoping to head back to school to get another degree in Computer Science or a related field. This will allow me to become more well rounded in other areas beyond English, and hopefully I can relate my English skills to a more technical field in order to break into technical writing.
